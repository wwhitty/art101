	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to create an easy to navigate local file structure and add index.html files for each lab.</p>
	<h2> Difficulties</h2>
	<p> The file structure initial made sense with having index.html files in each lab folder, but the problem I kept having was accidently swtiching between different index.html files thinking it was my homepage. Initially I made my entire homepage in the lab3 index.html file so I had to move that one out of the lab3 folder and create a new index.html file for lab3, which is currently this page. Other than that, I had no real issues besides working on my speed with typing code.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This page is the index.html file that I created for lab 3. If you're currently reading this, it turned out successful.</p>
