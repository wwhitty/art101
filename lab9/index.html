		<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web </h1>
		<p> The point of this lab is to work with a partner and experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> I had a few problems with this lab. I didn't know the end result for this lab so I wasn't sure what had to be done. I followed the steps and after testing it in the console and fixing the small errors, everything ended up working. I was just confused on what our end result was supposed to be. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The result is below in the Script Output section. </p>
