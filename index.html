		<h3> A little about myself...</h3>
			<p> I am a fourth year Film and Digital Media student. I play for the UCSC Men's Basketball Team. I technically have been enrolled in Santa Cruz for four years, but I took a Leave of Absence for two quarters last year, delaying my graduation to Winter 2023. After I graduate, my goal is to get a job within the Sports Media world working as a graphic designer for either a professional or collegiate sports team or a sports television network. </p>

			<p> I first started learning about graphic design in a class I took in high school. It was the basics of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and After Effects. In my first year of college, I started learning Photoshop on my own through YouTube videos and experimenting with different tools. I created a page on Instagram called @hoop.creative where I would create basketball designs. Not too long after I created the account, one of my designs got about 800 likes and I was so shocked that many people liked it. It made me feel good about my work and I was motivated to keep on making designs and posting them. Fast forward to today and I have over 2,500 followers on that account and 250+ designs that I have posted. I have been in a remote internship with Fox Sports as one of their graphic designers for their social media team since Februrary. I have learned so much throughout my graphic design experience and I cannot wait to see what the future holds.
