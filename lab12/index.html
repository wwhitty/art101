		<h1> Lab 12: Conditionals </h1>
		<p> The point of this lab is to work with a partner and create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> The problems I had in this lab had to do with my JavaScript. There were a couple of extra brackets as well as a mispelling of one of the variables in my function. This caused the button function not to work properly and to get the same result no matter what the user inputted. I was able to fix it and now it works. </p>
