		<h1> Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms </h1>
		<p> The point of this lab is to work with a partner and experiment with JS events.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> It really helped going over this in class with the professor. I understood what was going on and what the code meant. The problems I ran into happened when I checked my code in the console. There were two things that said something was not a function. I compared my notes with the code that I wrote down to make sure everything was correct and the only thing that was not correct was the capitalization of the function "getElementBy Id." Another issue I ran into was that when I first pushed the button, no action popped up on the screen. This is because that capitalization that I mentioned in the previous sentence because without the correct function, that button click does not know where to put the results that the user inputs into the field.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
