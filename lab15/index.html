		<h1> Lab 15: AJAX </h1>
		<p> Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> This lab was somewhat difficult for me. I had to rewatch the lecture to understand it a little more because we are combining many differet previous labs together in this one. I really enjoyed all the examples he showed us in the lecture so I decided to try the Kanye West quote one and use that. The only problem I had in this lab was that I didn't capitalize my variable in the function, so an error popped up in my console. </p>
