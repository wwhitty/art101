		<h1> Lab 5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
		<p> The challenge of this lab was to work with your partner for creating and experimenting with JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> My partner and I actually had little to no problems with this lab. It was fairly short and easy. In the beginning of this lab, I was somewhat confused on the purpose of JavaScript because it was different from HTML. I didn't know it was more about programming, which meant it was more interactive than HTML and CSS. Once I understood that, I learned what I was coding were actions rather than exactly what would appear on screen. I would set variables of certain keywords and add those key words to get a specific output. These are the types of actions I am referring to where there is an input and output. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> If you are reading this now, you are looking the index.html file that I created for this lab. Listed below is the Script Output for the JavaScript that I did for this lab. The lab was successful. </p>
