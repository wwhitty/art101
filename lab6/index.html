		<h1> Lab 5: Arrays and Objects </h1>
		<p> The challenge of this lab was to work with your partner to create an Array in JavaScript for all the ways I get around Santa Cruz. We also had to make an object JavaScript for our main ride.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> This lab was fairly easy as well! The only difficulty I had was with practicing JavaScript in Google Chrome. I didn't know whether or not I had to use var before setting outputs for myTransportation and myMainRide. I kept getting undefined as the output from Google Chrome, but when I typed myTransportation or myMainRide, I got the values that I initially set. Another issue I had was how to do the console.log part at the end of task 1. After asking my partner for help and looking at the notes a little more, I figured out how to succesfully put console.log within the code and for it to print out what was required in the lab. Another problem I just experience after trying to load this .html file on google chrome is that my script output was not showing up. I inspected element and it didn't give me any errors within my .html file, but I had an issue in my JavaScript. I fixed it and it successfully loaded within Google Chrome. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
