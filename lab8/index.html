		<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
		<p> The point of this lab is to work with a partner and experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> I didn't have too many problems. Most of them came when I was testing out my code in the console before I put it into the JavaScript. The code was a little tricky to understand at first, but once I got it down it worked fine throughout the lab.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> To check the results, you have to go to the console to see the output.</p>
